				<h3>Model complex workflows</h3>
				<p>Go's pipelines are the building blocks with which you model your deployment pipeline. With Go, you can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and on-demand deployment. Parallel and sequential execution work exactly as you would expect. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/model-everything-fail-fast" target="_blank">Here's a glimpse</a> of what can be done in Go. With its fan-in/fan-out dependency management, Go always tries to do the "right thing," avoiding spurious builds and unverified configurations. Read more about fan-in/fan-out here

				<h3>Promote trusted artifacts</h3>
				<p> Every pipeline instance is anchored to a particular changeset. Go makes it easy to pass once-built binaries between stages so you know exactly what's being deployed and that the binary has been tested.

			<h3>See how things really work</h3>
			<p> Clich√©d as it may sound, Go's real power is in the visibility it provides over your end-to-end workflow. Go's Value Stream Map lets you track a change from commit to deploy at a glance. And when things go wrong, it's easy to see both the upstream cause and the downstream effects.

			<h3>Deploy any version, any time</h3>
			<p>Go's manual triggers allow you to deploy any known good version of your application to wherever you like. This empowers QA teams with self-service environments, and increases reliability of pushing to production. And, if necessary,it's securable and auditable.
